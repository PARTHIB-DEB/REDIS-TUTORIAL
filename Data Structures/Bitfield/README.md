# REDIS BITFIELDS

The command treats a Redis string as an array of bits, and is capable of addressing specific integer fields of varying bit widths and arbitrary non (necessary) aligned offset.

BITFIELD is able to operate with multiple bit fields in the same command call. It takes a list of operations to perform, and returns an array of replies, where each array matches the corresponding operation in the list of arguments.

# Commmands

  - ## BITFIELD
The command treats a Redis string as an array of bits, and is capable of addressing specific integer fields of varying bit widths and arbitrary non (necessary) aligned offset. In practical terms using this command you can set

for example, a signed 5 bits integer at bit offset 1234 to a specific value, retrieve a 31 bit unsigned integer from offset 4567. Similarly the command handles increments and decrements of the specified integers, providing guaranteed and well specified overflow and underflow behavior that the user can configure.

There is only one single command with numerous arguments - **BITFIELD**

  ```bash
      127.0.0.1:6379> BITFIELD bike:1:stats SET u32 #0 1000
      1) (integer) 0
      127.0.0.1:6379> BITFIELD bike:1:stats INCRBY u32 #0 -50 INCRBY u32 #1 1
      1) (integer) 950
      2) (integer) 1
      127.0.0.1:6379> BITFIELD bike:1:stats INCRBY u32 #0 500 INCRBY u32 #1 1
      1) (integer) 1450
      2) (integer) 2
      127.0.0.1:6379> BITFIELD bike:1:stats GET u32 #0 GET u32 #1
      1) (integer) 1450
      2) (integer) 2
  ```
